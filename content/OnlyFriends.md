This is a list of "services" i offer to my friends. This is mostly stuff i have fun doing, so you are my excuse to do it.

## Belts
You want a handmade belt that will last for decades? Here is how this works:
- You pay for the materials used, i do the work for free cuz i enjoy it.
- If you have a fitting belt:
  1. Try to keep the belt as straight as possible.
  2. Determine the best fitting hole, usually you can see it from the wear and tear.
  3. Measure the length from where the buckle is held by leather to the best fitting hole.
- If you dont have a fitting belt or to double check if what you measured makes remotely sense:
  - Measure the circumference where the belt would be. Keep in mind that the measuring tape is flat and a belt has some volume. The belt will not be the exact measured size.
  - This table as a rough guide:
    | Pants Width inch | belt length cm | german pants size  |
    | --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
    | 26              | 65             |                            |
    | 28              | 70             | 42                         |
    | 30              | 75             | 44                         |
    | 32              | 80             | 48                         |
    | 34              | 85             | 54                         |
    | 36              | 90             | 56                         |
    | 38              | 95             | 58                         |
    | 40              | 100            | 60                         |
    | 42              | 105            | 62                         |
    | 44              | 110            | 64                         |
    | 46              | 115            | 66                         |

    Sorry to all the lady-shaped bodies, i dont have enough knowledge about clothing sizes for you. Feel free to enlighten me!  

## Other small leather goods
We dont like zippers. But maybe you need one nevertheless?  
I've got a little collection of patterns, so the possibility is there that i already got a pattern for what you want. Etsy got a lot of patterns for a reasonable price. Keep in mind that depending on the leather used a pattern might not always work!  
### Wallets
Integrated coin purses are a challenge. A challenge i am willing to accept.  
More than 6 cards (EC-Card, ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1) gonna make the wallet a thicc boi.  
### Cardholders
Depending on how many there are possibilities for smart "pull-out"-helpers.
### Bags
If you want a bag where an item has a dedicated place and should fit snuggly, i need either the item or a mockup-model.  
### Harnesses
Harnesses are way easier to make if i can take measurements of your body.  
If that is, for whatever reason, not possible, we can work something out.  
### Watch Straps
Really helpful if you know the exact model of watch you want a strap for.  
Otherwise some measurements, depending on strap style, are necessary.
### Anything
Hit me up and lets try to create something unique!
