This is a list of "services" i offer to my friends. This is mostly stuff i have fun doing, so you are my excuse to do it.

## Belts
You want a handmade belt that will last for decades? Here is how this works:
- You pay for the materials used, i do the work for free cuz i enjoy it.
- If you have a fitting belt:
  1. Try to keep the belt as straight as possible.
  2. Determine the best fitting hole, usually you can see it from the wear and tear.
  3. Measure the length from where the buckle is held by leather to the best fitting hole.
- If you dont have a fitting belt or to double check if what you measured makes remotely sense:
  - Measure the circumference where the belt would be. Keep in mind that the measuring tape is flat and a belt has some volume. The belt will not be the exact measured size.
  - This table as a rough guide:
    | Pants Width inch | belt length cm | german pants size  |
