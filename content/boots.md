You want a good pair o' boots?  

### Red Wing
Iconic. Classic gateway drug. More functional.  
- Offline Stores for try on.
- Many Goodyear welted models (very gud repairability)
- Very good leather (no vegan options)
- Good price/performance
- Needs break in  

Recommended models: Iron Ranger, Blacksmith

### Thursday
More dressy.  
- Difficult to get in the EU
- Very good price/performance.
- Not always welted. (repairability depends on model)
- Bit thinner leather, some cushioning on the insole, less PITA to break in  

Recommended models: Captain Classic, Heritage Captain, President Classic  
Note: Depending on exact model the welt might be made out of non-leather. Or not even welted.

### Solovair
Iconic [[doc-martens\|Doc Martens]] alternative. While looking a lot like a really tough boot, some compromisses are made for comfort and price.
- The only competetive priced Docs alternative
- Plastic welt, still repairable.
- Iconic look.
- If you cant withstand the break in period in these, dont even bother with traditional made boots.  

Recommended models: Black Greasy 8 Eye Derby Boot  
Note: It seems like their quality is going downhill. Even more subjective view backed by some posts on reddit.

### Jim Green
Distinct look. Roomy toeboxes. Barefoot options. Functional.
- Stitchdown construction. Cheaper to make, still good repairability.
- Cuts costs where it doesnt really matter, uses high quality where it matters.
- Generally more "anatomically good" lasts
- Customizing. Nearly every part of a model can be customized, while it increases the price, its still relatively cheap.
- Crazy good price/performance

## Craft n Glory

## Avoid These

- White's (maybe)
- Chippewa

## Not happy until now?
Either you want something special in terms of look or have other requirements for your boots, in which case: [[eu-shoes]]

## Appendix
Small details & niche knowledge.
### Reinforced Toe Cap
From just a stiffener to a true double layer toe cap.
- Sometimes just decorative (no double leather layer)
- Traditionally done with very stiff leather inserts, modern solutions are plastics (often cheaper, not necessarily worse) 
- Stops the toe box from collapsing, causing rubbing spots.
### Heel counter
- If your boot doesnt fit your foot, you might experience a pressure point just above the stiff part of the heel. I currently dont know how to fix this, apart from some good ol' cushioning.
- Stabilizes your foot, especially when the foot is pronating/supinating (aka the center of your foot is not in line with the center of your leg)

### Shank
- Not really needed for wedge soles
- Highly recommended for any shoewear with a heel (looking at you [[doc-martens]])
- Supports your foot, so the shoe doesnt collapse turning your foot into a U
- Nice for shoveling or ladders.
