You want a good pair o' boots?  

### Red Wing
Iconic. Classic gateway drug. More functional.  
- Offline Stores for try on.
- Many Goodyear welted models (very gud repairability)
- Very good leather (no vegan options)
- Very good price/performance
Recommended models: Iron Ranger, Blacksmith

### Thursday
More dressy.  
- Difficult to get in the EU
- Very good price/performance.
- Not always welted. (repairability depends on model)
- Bit thinner leather, some cushioning on the insole, less PITA to break in
Recommended models: Captain Classic, Heritage Captain, President Classic
Note: Depending on exact model the welt might be made out of non-leather. Or not even welted.

### Solovair
Iconic Doc Martens alternative. While looking a lot like a really tough boot, some compromisses are made for comfort and price.
- The only competetive priced Docs alternative
- Plastic welt, still repairable.
- Iconic look.
- If you cant withstand the break in period in these, dont even bother with traditional made boots.
Recommended models: Black Greasy 8 Eye Derby Boot
Note: It seems like their quality is going downhill. Even more subjective view backed by some posts on reddit.
